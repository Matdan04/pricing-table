Flexbox Pricing Table
This repository contains a modern, responsive Pricing Table designed using Flexbox. Styled with elegance and simplicity, the pricing table is implemented with HTML and CSS, leveraging the power of the Flexbox layout module for optimal layout flexibility and alignment. The design is made responsive using a media query that shifts the layout from a row to a column when the viewport size is reduced, ensuring that the pricing plans are displayed beautifully on all devices.

The project uses Google Fonts for typography and provides a clean, user-friendly interface that includes three distinct pricing plans: Basic, Standard, and Premium. Each plan comes with its own set of features and a clear call-to-action for user sign-up.
